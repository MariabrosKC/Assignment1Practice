					</div>
					<p>
						This is a test game, developed using the GODOT Engine, version 3.5. This game was exported to HTML and loaded on itch.io. You are now playing this game on itch.io 
					    This is one of 2 games I developed as part of my Games Design & Analysis Course in Kerry College.  
					    This game demonstates my ability to devise a game concept, design characters and gameplay and implement using a modern game engine.
						Godot aims to offer a fully integrated game development environment. It allows developers to create a game, needing no other tools beyond 
						those used for content creation (visual assets, music, etc.). The engine's architecture is built around the concept of a tree of "nodes". 
						Nodes are organized inside of "scenes", which are reusable, instanceable, inheritable, and nestable groups of nodes. All game resources, 
						including scripts and graphical assets, are saved as part of the computer's file system (rather than in a database). This storage solution is 
						intended to facilitate collaboration between game development teams using software version control systems

					<p>Itch.io (stylized as itch.io) is a website for users to host, sell and download indie games. Launched in March 2013 by Leaf Corcoran, the service hosts over 500,000 games and items (assets, ebooks, music) as of April 2022.

						Itch.io also allows users to host game jams, events where participants have limited time (usually 1–3 days) to create a game. Game Off and Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam have been hosted on Itch.io.
						
						Due to the amount of freedom developers have on Itch.io, it is widely regarded as a good way for new video game developers to practice creating games and start making money from their games.[4] Itch.io's game jams are also seen as a way 
						for new video game developers to get publicity and improve their game developing skills.

						<h3>Game Event POster</h3>

					<p>There isn't an artist in history who didn't draw inspiration from the creative 
						giants that preceded them. Being exposed to (and studying) the work of past and contemporary artists is a critical step 
						in any young artist's growth.

						By analyzing great artwork you begin to form an idea of what works and what doesn't. It's one of the easiest 
						(and most enjoyable) ways to learn some of the basic rules of composition, lighting, and design.
						
						While looking at pretty pictures isn't going to teach you the technical side of computer graphics (CG), it will help 
						you make the most of your tools and software.</p>

					<p>Shigeru Miyamoto
						The game artist is the greatest game artist of all time. What he has achieved is what the video game industry is modernized today. If one name the gamers 
						all over the world would know, it would be the name of this game artist. Shigeru Miyamoto’s accomplishments has become an icon of the videogame industry.
						We do not need to say what he has achieved as he is the icon of videogames. Without him, the video game landscape probably would not be what it is today 
						and his contributions help to revive and essentially save the videogame industry in the mid 1980s.
						
						Shigeru Miyamoto, the game artist, designer, producer and game director of Nintendo as one of its representative directors, is the creator of some of the 
						most acclaimed and best-selling game franchise s of all time, including Mario and The Legend of Zelda, which the latter has a series by Netflix. Even today, 
						there is no one who does not know Super Mario. Both Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda, that Miyamoto created, brought massive successes for the Nintendo 
						Entertainment System (NES). These games helped Nintendo and the NES to dominate the console game market. His games has been flagships of every Nintendo video game 
						console, from the arcade machines of the late 1970s to the present day.
